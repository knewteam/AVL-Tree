## How to use github

### Sending your work to the team

- Open vs code in the repository you cloned from the github by opening the terminal on the repository folder and typing "code ."

- use git branch to check if you are in the right branch, which should your be your branch "dev/<yourName>". The branch you are in will be marked with a "\*\*\*" and will be on green letters.

- "git add <name-of-the-files-you-modified>" or "git add ." to add all the files

- you can use "git status" to see which files were added or modified.

- git commit -m "<message-with-the-changes-you-made>"

- git push

- On github, go to your branch, and make a pull request to the branch "develop". Make sure your are requesting a pull to the right branch! You should not make pull requests to the "master" branch.

- Wait for 2 developers to approve your pull request.

- If your changes where not accepted you can make the changes in your work and then do another "git push". It is not necessary to make a pull request again.
